# FREE (TIME EVENT)
This obfuscator is currently for free as a thanks for the support after my account got termed.

Time Period:
Two Months

Any use with this while its on free is not in my power, take it as a treat and do your best while keys are currently removed.

I removed the key system for a short time period otherwise it wouldn't really be free, you would just have the EXE file.
